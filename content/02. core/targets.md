# Targets

Policy Reporter supports different targets to send new PolicyReport results. This makes it possible to create a log or get notified as soon as a new validation result is detected. The set of supported tools are based on personal needs and user requests. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you want support for a new target.

## Target Configurations

Each Target has similar configuration values. Required is always a valid and accessible __host__ or __webhook__ configuration to be able to send the events.

### Filter Possibilities

Different optional configurations allow you to define which results should be send to the given target. These configurations are available for every target and can be used together with `channels` to route notifications to various clients of the same type of target.

#### minimumPriority

Only events with the given priority or higher are sent. By default each priority is sent. See [priority mapping](/core/priority-mapping) for details.

#### sources

Send only results of the configured sources. By default results from all sources are sent.

#### skipExistingOnStartup

On startup, Policy Reporter registers all existing results in the cluster. By default these results are ignored. If you also want to send them to your target, you can set this option to *false*.

#### filter *(since AppVersion 2.5.0)*

The new filter option allows you to define include and exclude rules for the namespaces, policies and priorities of a result. Filters for namespaces and policies have wildcard support.

```yaml
slack:
  webhook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/123..."
  skipExistingOnStartup: true
  filter:
    namespaces:
      include: ["team-a-*"]
    priorities:
      exclude: ["info", "debug"]
    policies:
      include: ["require-*"]
```

### Channels *(since AppVersion 2.5.0)*

The new `channels` option allows you to define multiple configurations of the same type of target. Thus, in combination with filters, you can route your notifications to different target configurations. Channels have the same configuration properties as the root target configuration.

See the different available targets for concrete example and usage of `channels` and `filter`.

### SecretRef

Instead of defining your credentials or webhooks directly, you can also use the `secretRef` configuration to define an already existing __Secret__ by name. If the secret does not exist, the target is skipped.

The Secret should contain the related configuration as `key`. Supported keys are host, webhook, username, password, token, credentials, accessKeyID and secretAccessKey - depending on the related target. Only exception is `token`, which is dedicated for `webhook` targets and is added as Authorization header.

The `secretRef` is also supported for channels, so you can use different secrets for different channels.

```yaml
# values.yaml
target:
  slack:
    minimumPriority: "warning"
    skipExistingOnStartup: true
    channels:
    # secretRef configuration
    - secretRef: "team-a-slack-webhook"
      filter:
        namespaces:
          include: ["team-a-*"]
    # inline configuration
    - webhook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/456..."
      filter:
        namespaces:
          include: ["team-b-*"]
```

related Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: team-a-slack-webhook
type: Opaque
data:
  webhook: aHR0cHM6Ly9ob29rcy5zbGFjay5jb20vc2VydmljZXMvVDAuLi4= # https://hooks.slack.com/services/T0...
```

### Certificate

Available for `loki`, `elasticsearch`, `teams`, `webhook` and `ui` targets. Can be used to configure the __path__ to your custom certificate, added over `extraVolumes` to the pod.

### skipTLS

Available for `loki`, `elasticsearch`, `teams`, `webhook` and `ui` targets. Can be used to skip the TLS check.

## Grafana Loki

Policy Reporter can send results directly to Grafana Loki without the need of Promtail. Each result includes all available information as labels as well as a `source` label with `policy-reporter` as value. To query all messages from Policy Reporter, use `{source="policy-reporter"}` as the query.

### Example

The minimal configuration for Grafana Loki requires a valid and accessible host.

```yaml
loki:
  host: "http://loki.loki-stack:3100"
  path: "/loki/api/v1/push"
  minimumPriority: "warning"
  skipExistingOnStartup: true
  sources:
  - kyverno
```

### Channel Example

Channels uses the same `host`, `minimumPriority` and `skipExistingOnStartup` configuration as the root target if not defined.

#### Send notification based on namespace prefix with a related Team label

```yaml
loki:
  host: "http://loki.loki-stack:3100"
  path: "/loki/api/v1/push"
  minimumPriority: "warning"
  skipExistingOnStartup: true
  channels:
  - filter:
      namespaces:
        include: ["teame-a-*"]
    customLabels:
      team: "Team A"
  - filter:
      namespaces:
        include: ["teame-b-*"]
    customLabels:
      team: "Team B"
```

## Elasticsearch

Policy Reporter sends results in a JSON representation and all available information to a customizable index. This index can be expanded by selecting one of the different rotations or *none* to disable this function. By default Policy Reporter creates a new index on a daily basis.

### Additional configuration

* __index__ is used as an index name. Uses `policy-reporter` if not configured.
* __rotation__ is used to create rotating indexes by adding the rotation date as suffix to the index name. Possible values are `daily`, `monthly`, `annually` and `none`. Uses `daily` if not configured.
* __username__ and __password__ to use HTTP Basic Auth based authentication.

### Example

The minimal configuration for Elasticsearch requires a valid and accessible host.

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  host: "http://elasticsearch.elk-stack:8080"
  index: "policy-reporter"
  rotation: "daily"
  minimumPriority: "warning"
  skipExistingOnStartup: true
  sources:
  - kyverno
```

### Channel Example

Channels uses the same `host`, `minimumPriority` and `skipExistingOnStartup`, `index`, `rotation` configuration as the root target if not defined.

#### Send only critical notifications to a different index with a daily rotation

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  host: "http://elasticsearch.elk-stack:8080"
  index: "policy-reporter"
  rotation: "weekly"
  minimumPriority: "warning"
  skipExistingOnStartup: true
  filter:
    priorities:
      exclude: ["critical"]
  channels:
  - index: "critical-violations"
    rotation: "daily"
    filter:
      priorities:
        include: ["critical"]
```

   }
}
```
## S3 compatible Storage

Policy Reporter can also send results to S3 compatible services like __MinIO__, __Yandex__ or __AWS S3__.

It persists each result as JSON in the following structure: `s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/YYYY-MM-DD/<policy-name>-<result-id>-YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.json`
